This is a small dashboard view to display the value of cryptocurrencies and record trading activity.  A portfolio view is displayed with position valuation.  Positions can be traded in and out, with a running total P&L displayed alongside the portfolio.

# Design

The app is single-page and uses the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework.  [AWS Lambdas](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) are deployed to allow serverless access to DynamoDB storage.  The lambda code is supplied in the main branch to allow deployment.
